## Connection Resolver \*.tdr

Defines the connection to your data source.

**File extension:** .tdr

See [resolvers](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tree/master/samples/components/resolvers) for examples.

The Connection Resolver is made up of several components:

---

### connection-builder

Builds the ODBC ConnectString or JDBC Connection URL.

**Type:** JavaScript

#### JavaScript function call signature:

**Input:** attr, a dictionary of key/value pairs

```javascript
{"server" : "myserver.somewhere.net", "username" : "myusername"}
```

**Return:** vector of formatted key=value pairs

```javascript
["DRIVER={My ODBC Driver}", "UID=myusername", "Host=myserver.somewhere.net"];
```

---

### connection-properties

Similar to connection-builder but is used to build the JDBC properties file.

**Type:** JavaScript

#### JavaScript function call signature:

**Input:** attr, a dictionary of key/value pairs

```javascript
{"server" : "myserver.somewhere.net", "username" : "myusername"}
```

**Return:** vector of formatted key=value pairs that will be written to the properties file

```javascript
["UID=myusername", "Host=myserver.somewhere.net"];
```

---

### connection-matcher

Determines if two sets of required connection attributes match. This is optional and in most cases will not be needed.

**Type:** JavaScript

#### JavaScript function call signature:

**Input:** attr1, attr2, two dictionaries of key/value pairs

```javascript
{"server" : "myserver.somewhere.net", "username" : "myusername"}

{"server" : "myserver.somewhere.net", "username" : "someoneelse"}
```

**Return:** true or false if the attributes match

---

### connection-normalizer

Defines the unique set of connection attributes which is used to generate a connection "key" and has important security considerations. Connections can be reused and shared within Tableau processes based on this key, so it must contain attributes whose values will be unique in a given security context. Username is a commonly used attribute that will make a unique connection for each user, for example.

**Type:** JavaScript or XML

XML is prefered since it is more performant and normalization is done many times per connection.
The following table shows the most commonly used attributes. Custom attributes may also be added in the XML.

_Attribute names_

| Attribute                  | Description                                                        |

| server                     | Connection attribute for the server                                |
| service                    | Connection attribute for the service                               |
| sslcert                    | Connection attribute for the SSL Certfile                          |
| sslmode                    | Connection attribute for the SSL Mode                              |
| username                   | Connection attribute for the user name                             |
| warehouse                  | Connection attribute for the Warehouse                             |

#### JavaScript function call signature:

**Input:** attr, a dictionary of key/value pairs.

```javascript
{"server" : "myserver.somewhere.net", "username" : "myusername"}
```

**Return:** vector of attribute names. The following example values are common for username and password authentication.

```javascript
["server", "port", "dbname", "username", "password"];
```

### driver-resolver

Determines the driver name to use when connecting. This is mainly used for ODBC connections but can be used for JDBC as well. You can specify regex or string matches for the driver name, specify driver versions (if the driver correctly returns them through the ODBC interface), and have a list of multiple drivers that can be used in order.

**Type:** XML

See [resolvers](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tree/master/samples/components/resolvers) for examples.

## C++ objects and methods available to your JavaScript

### Logging

You can write to the Tableau log file (tabprotosrv.txt). Writing to the log file requires Debug level logging (-DLogLevel=Debug).

Use care when logging so that you donâ€™t expose sensitive information like passwords and other authentication information.

    logging.Log("Hi")

### Connection Helper

_Attribute names_

| Function                | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| attributeAuthentication | Connection attribute for the authentication type |
| attributeClass          | Connection attribute for the connection type     |
| attributeDatabase       | Connection attribute for the database            |
| attributeInitialSQL     | Connection attribute for initial SQL             |
| attributePassword       | Connection attribute for the password            |
| attributePort           | Connection attribute for the port                |
| attributeServer         | Connection attribute for the server              |
| attributeService        | Connection attribute for the service             |
| attributeSSLCert        | Connection attribute for the SSL Certfile        |
| attributeSSLMode        | Connection attribute for the SSL Mode            |
| attributeUsername       | Connection attribute for the user name           |
| attributeWarehouse      | Connection attribute for the Warehouse           |
| keywordODBCUsername     | ODBC Username keyword                            |
| keywordODBCPassword     | ODBC Password keyword                            |

_Functions_

    String FormatKeyValuePair(String key, String value);

Format the attributes as 'key=value'. By default, some values are escaped or wrapped in curly braces to follow the ODBC standard, but you can also do it here if needed.

    bool MatchesConnectionAttributes(Object attr, Object inKey);

Invokes attribute matching code.

    Map ParseODBCConnectString(String odbcConnectString);

Returns a map of the key value pairs defined in the ```odbc-connect-string-extras``` string.

    String GetPlatform();

Returns the name of the os Tableau is running on. Possible values are:
- win
- mac
- linux

Example:

    formattedParams.push(connectionHelper.FormatKeyValuePair(key, params[key]));

    params[connectionHelper.keywordODBCUsername] = attr[connectionHelper.attributeUsername];

    odbcConnectStringExtrasMap = connectionHelper.ParseODBCConnectString(attr["odbc-connect-string-extras"]);
    
_Throw Tableau Exception_

Normally, throwing an exception in a JavaScript component will show the user a more generic error message in the product. To have a custom error message appear in Tableau, use the following format:

    return connectionHelper.ThrowTableauException("Custom Error Message");

The full error is always logged.

---

### Driver Locator

_Functions_

    String LocateDriver (Object attr);

Get the name of your chosen driver that was matched using the rules in your TDR file.

    String LocateDriverVersion(Object attr);

Get the version number of the chosen driver as a string.

Example:

    formattedParams.push(connectionHelper.FormatKeyValuePair(driverLocator.keywordDriver, driverLocator.LocateDriver(attr)));
